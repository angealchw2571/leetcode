# Introduction
Hi there! My name is Angeal Cheong, and I'm a Theatre Practitioner turned Software Engineer. My industry was hit hard during covid and hence I commited myself deeply into programming and loving it since. I am starting this as a challenge to myself to constantly practice leetcode problems, and to get better at Data Structures and Algorithms. 

# LeetCode Accomplishments
Here is a list of the LeetCode problems I have solved so far:

* [Number of Good Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-pairs/)
* [Richest Customer Wealth](https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/)
